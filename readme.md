# tiny-jssr
 
The simplest native Javascript SSR template development idea that takes care of the development experience

- Use template strings and native JS tag functions
- Combining `VSCode` and `lit-html` plugins can have a very complete development experience of `css-in-js` and `html-in-js`
- CSS className is automatically generated and bound to solve style pollution problems
- Client side scripts and server level scripts are written in the same JS file without affecting each other
- Self-organizing `JSX-like` component development method
